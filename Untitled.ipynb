    "### Problem statement\n",
    "For this project you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing. You may pick any phenomenon you wish <br> – you might pick one that is\n",
    "of interest to you in your personal or professional life. <br>Then, rather than collect data\n",
    "related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python.<br><br>\n",
    "We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose. <br>\n",
    "Specifically, in this project you should:\n",
    "- Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.\n",
    "- Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.\n",
    "- Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.\n",
    "- Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.\n",
    "Note that this project is about simulation – you must synthesise a data set. <br> <br>Some students may already have some real-world data sets in their own files. It is okay tobase your synthesised data set on these should you wish (please reference it if you do),<br>\n",
    "but the main task in this project is to create a synthesised data set."
